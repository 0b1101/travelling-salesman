# The travelling salesman problem

This repository presents a C implementation that solves the classic Travelling Salesman Problem using both brute force and a graph-based approach.
  

## Problem description
The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem. It asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"


## Solution 
This repository offers two distinct approaches for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). For detailed explanations of each approach, please refer to their respective folders.

## Running the program 
If you wish to test the program for yourself, follow the steps: 

 1. Download the repository to your local machine. 
 2. Open the folder of your chosen approach in your terminal.
 3. Type `make`.
